# 2019 Advent of Code

My code for https://adventofcode.com/2019

Requires Python (At least version 2.7)


*NOTE*: The code within is to quickly solve the problems for the Advent of Code for my specific inputs. It is *NOT* coded with maintainability or for all possible Advent of Code inputs and hasn't been optimized for performance. Also, I get bored of it rather easily.. Last year, I stopped after hitting a problem where my first solution didn't solve it immediately. Expect more of the same this year.
